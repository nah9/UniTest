| Content description     | Library written in pure IEC 61131-3 Structured text that can be used for unit testing of any PLC POU. This library has arisen from the need of having a manufacturer and IDE independent unit test framework that is easily portable to other platform as the community requires. There are good unit frameworks existing for TwinCat, Codesys, B&R and many more platforms but none of them quite solve the extreme cases. |
